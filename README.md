# xorshift32-encryption
Simple symmetric cipher that used XORSHIFT32 for the random number generation.

I had to write a program for an assignment that encrypts and decrypts BMP files using a symmetric cipher. This one, in particular, uses XORSHIFT32 for it's number generation, the seed being provided by the key.
